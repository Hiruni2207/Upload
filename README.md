## Features

- Forecast hotel revenue for different **meal periods** (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner).
- Predict revenue for **multiple revenue centers**.
- Compare various forecasting models including:
  - XGBoost
  - SARIMAX
  - Facebook Prophet
  - LSTM / CNN-LSTM
  - LightGBM
  - Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)
- Evaluate model performance using RMSE, MAE, and MAPE metrics.
